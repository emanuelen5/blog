In this post I'm testing Sphinx!

# Installing

Initially the directory structure looks as follows

$ tree
.

├── make.bat
├── Makefile
├── requirements.txt
└── source
    ├── conf.py
    ├── index.rst
    ├── _static
    └── _templates

4 directories, 5 files
```

# Page format
Sphinx pages are written in reStructuredText (RST) which is a much more potent language than Markdown, but also more difficult. [Here is a simple introduction](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html) to RST with a lot of good examples (similar to [RST primer from the Sphinx documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html), but simpler to understand). If you want to get a lot more technical about the tools then check out [this page](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/restructuredtext-rst-tutorial-0). Otherwise check out [the specifications for RST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) which contains all of the details.
