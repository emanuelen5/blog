In this post I'm testing Sphinx!

# Installing

```bash
$ pip install sphinx
```

```bash
$ sphinx-quickstart

Initially the directory structure looks as follows
```bash
$ tree
.
├── build/
├── make.bat
├── Makefile
├── requirements.txt
└── source/
    ├── conf.py
    ├── index.rst
    ├── _static
    └── _templates

4 directories, 5 files
```

There is a combined tool for rebuilding and serving the web page called `sphinx-autobuild` which can be installed using pip (`pip install sphinx autobuild`) and used as:
```bash
$ sphinx-autobuild -b html
```

I however had some trouble with using it together with Vim since it rebuilt too many files and *twice* for each file I changed (due to Vim creating .swp-files?). I therefore switched to using the good old faithful `entr` (get it with `apt install entr` on Debianesque systems):
```bash
# Do this in one terminal
$ while sleep 1; do find . | entr -d make html; done
# And this in another terminal session
$ python -m http.server 4001 --directory "build/html"
```

I even added these as targets in the Makefile:
```Makefile
# Minimal makefile for Sphinx documentation
#

# You can set these variables from the command line, and also
# from the environment for the first two.
SPHINXOPTS    ?=
SPHINXBUILD   ?= sphinx-build
SOURCEDIR     = source
BUILDDIR      = build
PORT          ?= 4001

# Put it first so that "make" without argument is like "make help".
help:
    @$(SPHINXBUILD) -M help "$(SOURCEDIR)" "$(BUILDDIR)" $(SPHINXOPTS) $(O)

livehtml:
    sphinx-autobuild -p $(PORT) -b html -i ".*.*" "$(SOURCEDIR)" "$(BUILDDIR)/html" $(SPHINXOPTS) $(O)

watchhtml:
    while sleep 1; do find "$(SOURCEDIR)" | entr -d $(MAKE) html; done

webserver:
    python -m http.server $(PORT) --directory "$(BUILDDIR)/html"

.PHONY: help livehtml watchhtml webserver Makefile

# Catch-all target: route all unknown targets to Sphinx using the new
# "make mode" option.  $(O) is meant as a shortcut for $(SPHINXOPTS).
%: Makefile
    $(SPHINXBUILD) -M $@ "$(SOURCEDIR)" "$(BUILDDIR)" $(SPHINXOPTS) $(O)

```

They can then be built using `make watchhtml` and `make webserver`. Go to the page by visiting [localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001).

# Page format
Sphinx pages are written in reStructuredText (RST) which is a much more potent language than Markdown, but also more difficult. [Here is a simple introduction](https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html) to RST with a lot of good examples (similar to [RST primer from the Sphinx documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html), but simpler to understand). If you want to get a lot more technical about the tools then check out [this page](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/restructuredtext-rst-tutorial-0). Otherwise check out [the specifications for RST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) which contains all of the details.
