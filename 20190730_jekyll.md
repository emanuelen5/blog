Today I'm trying out Jekyll!

## Installing
If you are familiar with Ruby on rails, this should go smoothly. See the [Jekyll page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/#instructions) for the basic instructions. Since I was new, I just wanted to add the sidesteps I had to go from the instructions:

1. Install a full Ruby development environment <br>
    Apparently I already had this installed (Ubuntu 16):

    ```bash
    $ sudo apt install ruby
    [...]
    ruby is already the latest version (1:2.3.0+1).
    $ ruby -v
    ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
    ```

2. Install Jekyll and bundler gems

    ```bash
    # I had not set up so gems could be installed globally, so I had to install it under my user
    $ gem install --user-install jekyll bundler
    # Then I had to add the Ruby gems to the path so I could execute them
    $ export PATH="$PATH:~/.gem/ruby/2.3.0/bin"
    ```

3. Create a new site at `./myblog` and go into the new directory

    ```bash
    $ jekyll new myblog
    # Here bundler complained that it could not install all dependencies and failed (due to
    # lack of permissions). I therefore installed it to my user directory instead.
    $ cd myblog
    $ bundler install --path ~/.gem/ruby/2.3.0/gems
    ```

4. Build the site and make it available on a local server at port 4000

    ```bash
    $ bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000
    ```

Now you can start adding posts in by adding the to the `_posts/` folder.

## Post format
The posts are written in Markdown with a few additions.
