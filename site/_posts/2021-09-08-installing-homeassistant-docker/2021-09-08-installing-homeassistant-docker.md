## Installation

This is the guide that I have followed for installing Home Assistant on Docker: <https://github.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer>

It is split in X steps:

1. Install prerequisites. This means the libraries and programs that are needed for the installation, such as Docker, NetworkManager, etc. ([see here](https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/blob/master/adr/0014-home-assistant-supervised.md)).
2. Download the installer script:
    ```console
    $ curl -Lo installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer/master/installer.sh
    ```
3. Run the installer script for your specific machine configuration:
    ```console
    $ bash installer.sh --machine raspberrypi4  # Not rpi64(!)
    ```

You should now see a truckload of containers running when you run the command `docker ps` (except for the addons):
```console
$ docker ps -a

```

This might seem daunting at first. But, basically, each program runs in its own container: like Home Assistant; a supervisor that keeps track of updates and the home assistant state; other helper containers; and addons.
Each container has its own version, state and log. All of which can be accessed either through Home Assistant (version and logs), or by using the docker commands.

## Migration
> Before migrating the files, make sure to stop Home Assistant. This can be done with the command `ha core stop` or `docker stop homeassistant`. When done, start it again by replacing *stop* with *start*.

The configuration files for the Dockerized Home Assistant are located under */usr/share/hassio/homeassistant*. Make sure to move your existing files there, if you have any (e.g. *configuration.yaml*, and possibly even login tokens).

## Install some addons
The next step would be to actually start using the supervised HA features, by for example, installing some addons:
