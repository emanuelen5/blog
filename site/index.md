Welcome to my blog site!

I occasionally write [Posts]({% link posts.md %}) and [Tips]({% link tips.md %}) on different topics. I love open source, *Python*, *Bash*, *Unix* and other cool tools.

The source code for each page is available by clicking the *source*-link in the footer, or by browsing the [Github page of the repository](https://github.com/emanuelen5/emanuelen5.github.io). It is automatically built by Jekyll as a Github action (on push), and deployed to Github pages as a static web page. Feel free to borrow any source code on the web page under the MIT license.

Regards, <br>
Erasmus
