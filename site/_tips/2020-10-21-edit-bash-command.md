# What
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>e</kbd> in the terminal when writing a long command.

# Why
So you can edit it (in multi-line mode) with your favorite editor.

# Reference
The Bash manual's section on miscellaneaous commands: <https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#index-edit_002dand_002dexecute_002dcommand-_0028C_002dx-C_002de_0029>

> edit-and-execute-command (C-x C-e)
> 
> Invoke an editor on the current command line, and execute the result as shell commands.  Bash attempts to invoke $VISUAL, $EDITOR, and emacs as the editor, in that order.
